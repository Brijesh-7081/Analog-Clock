Designed and developed a responsive analog clock using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for real-time functionality. 
The clock dynamically displays the current hour, minute, and second by calculating system time and rotating clock hands using JavaScript. 
Focused on clean UI design and smooth hand movement.
